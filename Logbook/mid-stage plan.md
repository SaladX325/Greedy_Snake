# min-stage plan
Now, almost half of the project is finished. The food module, snake head and body module, map module, and movement & growth of snake is finished. What need to do in the future is the wall moudule and gameover check. These two parts are harderst part in this project.

Basically, the wall is consisted by snake body and border of the map. It is varying as snake moves. However, based on print function, wall module might be solved quickly. One more thing is to think about how to save time to do so. What I gonna try is to calculated the forward coordinates when the input is finished. Judge whether the snake hit the wall when forming the wall for print function. It returns a flag "is_over" and "is_grow" at the same time. Though, it require two loops for print function. These two loops solves three problem (print, is_over, is_grow). I finished "is_grow" now. But, it is not in this way. I gonna update it soon.

In the end, bug fixing and memory/running_time updated is required. This step requires a lot of C++ knowledge. In this process, I may learn more knowledge about C++.
